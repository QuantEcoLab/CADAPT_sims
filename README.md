# CADAPT mosquito population control simulations

This repository contains the code for simulating mosquito population control interventions and strategies. The algorithm allows implementation of larvicide, adulticide and combined (larvicide+adulticide) treatment types in different treatment scenarios, differing based on:
- the number of consecutive repeats of treatment patterns, 
- the number of days treatment is (consecutively) implemented within a treatment pattern,
- the number of days without treatment within a treatment pattern (pause).

The code contained here was used for simulations presented in Djerdj et la. (2022) Modelling Can Reduce Contamination from Mosquito Population Control (DOI: https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1312631/v2).
